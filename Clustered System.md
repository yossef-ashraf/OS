### **Clustered Systems**

A **Clustered System** is composed of several interconnected computers or nodes that collaborate to improve performance, ensure high availability, or expand computational capacity. These systems are generally classified as **loosely-coupled systems**, where the nodes are independent but communicate with each other via a network. Below is an overview of the key components and benefits of clustered systems:

### **1. Interconnect:**
The interconnect is the medium through which the nodes in the clustered system communicate with each other. This network enables efficient data exchange and coordination between nodes.

- **Types of Interconnect:**
  - **LAN (Local Area Network):** Common in small and medium-sized clusters, providing sufficient communication speeds for general applications.
  - **InfiniBand:** A high-performance, low-latency interconnect used in large clustered systems, often for applications requiring extremely high throughput.
  - **High-performance networks:** Networks such as **10GbE** or **40GbE**, used in environments that require fast communication between nodes.

### **2. Nodes:**
The nodes are individual computers or servers that form the core of a clustered system. Each node is responsible for processing data, executing tasks, and collaborating with other nodes.

- **Types of Nodes:**
  - **Server Nodes:** These nodes are often dedicated to specific tasks or services.
  - **Storage Nodes:** Responsible for storing shared data, ensuring accessibility across all nodes in the cluster.
  - **Compute Nodes:** Handle computational tasks, such as processing large data sets or performing heavy calculations.

### **3. Storage Area Network (SAN):**
A **Storage Area Network (SAN)** connects storage devices (e.g., hard drives, network storage) to the nodes in the cluster. This system ensures fast, reliable access to shared data.

- **SAN Components:**
  - **SAN Switches:** Manage the data traffic between nodes and storage devices.
  - **Storage Units:** Devices like hard drives or NAS (Network Attached Storage) that store and share data within the cluster.

### **4. Cluster Management:**
Cluster management refers to the software tools used to oversee the operation of the clustered system. This includes tasks like load balancing, performance monitoring, failure management, and ensuring the efficient functioning of all nodes.

### **5. Storage and Redundancy:**
Clustered systems typically incorporate redundancy mechanisms to ensure data is replicated across nodes. This guarantees service continuity even in the case of node failures. Technologies like **RAID** or distributed storage systems like **Ceph** or **GlusterFS** are commonly used for this purpose.

### **Clustered Systems Overview (Loosely-Coupled Systems):**

Clustered systems, also known as **loosely-coupled systems**, involve connecting multiple independent computers or nodes to enhance performance and availability. The nodes in these systems can operate independently, but they are interconnected, allowing them to work together toward a common goal.

### **1. Composed of Two or More Individual Systems (or Nodes):**
Clustered systems consist of multiple independent machines or nodes. These nodes can either be:
  - **Single-processor systems:** Each node has a single CPU but can still contribute to the overall system's processing tasks.
  - **Multicore systems:** A node may have multiple processors or cores, enabling parallel execution of tasks.

The key characteristic is that these nodes collaborate to provide improved performance, redundancy, and resilience.

### **2. Node Types:**
The nodes within a clustered system can be:
  - **Single Processor Systems:** These nodes have one CPU but still contribute to the overall workload in a distributed manner.
  - **Multicore Systems:** These nodes contain multiple cores that allow them to execute several threads or processes simultaneously, improving performance.

### **3. Shared Storage and Network Connectivity:**
  - **Shared Storage:** Clustered systems often have shared storage resources accessible by all nodes. This improves data consistency, availability, and access speed. Shared storage is typically implemented using **Network Attached Storage (NAS)** or **Storage Area Networks (SAN)**.
  - **LAN Connectivity:** The nodes communicate via a **Local Area Network (LAN)**, ensuring fast communication, data transfer, and synchronization of operations across the cluster.

### **Applications and Benefits of Clustered Systems:**

1. **High Availability:**
   - In the event of a node failure, workloads can be shifted to other nodes, ensuring minimal downtime and continued operation of the system.

2. **Scalability:**
   - Clustered systems can scale horizontally by adding more nodes, which increases processing power and storage capacity as needed.

3. **Load Balancing:**
   - Tasks are distributed across the nodes, balancing the load and preventing any single node from becoming overwhelmed.

4. **Fault Tolerance:**
   - Redundancy mechanisms ensure that the failure of one node does not affect the entire system. This improves system reliability and resilience.

### **Examples of Clustered Systems:**

1. **Hadoop Clusters:**
   - Used in big data processing, where multiple nodes in the cluster work together to distribute data storage and computation tasks.

2. **Web Server Clusters:**
   - Multiple web servers in a cluster can share the load of incoming web traffic, ensuring the system can handle high volumes of requests efficiently.

### **Conclusion:**

Clustered systems are ideal for scenarios requiring scalability, reliability, and fault tolerance. They are widely used in cloud computing, data centers, scientific computing, and enterprise IT environments, where high performance and continuous availability are critical. By combining multiple independent nodes, clustered systems can handle large workloads while maintaining redundancy and improving overall system performance.
